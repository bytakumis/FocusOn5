## Background
> "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts." - Aristotle
- **Reason:** {Why this project is being undertaken}  
- **Vision:** {What the world will look like after this project is completed}  

## 5% Target
> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

## Breakdown
> "Divide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it." - René Descartes

Use tools like mind maps to write down tasks in detail while focusing on the following points:  
- Tasks should be clear enough to start without hesitation.  
- Any bottlenecks should be identified and broken down into actionable tasks to resolve them.
